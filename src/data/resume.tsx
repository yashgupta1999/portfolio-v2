      abstract: "Designed an asynchronously weight updating federated learning algorithm for AI-on-Edge IoT systems, enhancing data privacy by eliminating the need for centralized data sharing. Applied the approach to face mask detection, traditionally a centralized computer vision task, by distributing learning tasks across users. Investigated performance trade-offs between synchronous and asynchronous weight updates, introducing a penalization mechanism to optimize model aggregation. Experimental results demonstrated comparable accuracy to centralized training while significantly reducing transmission time overhead.",
