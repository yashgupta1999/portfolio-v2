      abstract: "Designed an asynchronously weight updating federated learning algorithm for AI-on-Edge IoT systems, enhancing data privacy by eliminating the need for centralized data sharing. Applied the approach to face mask detection, traditionally a centralized computer vision task, by distributing learning tasks across users. Investigated performance trade-offs between synchronous and asynchronous weight updates, introducing a penalization mechanism to optimize model aggregation. Experimental results demonstrated comparable accuracy to centralized training while significantly reducing transmission time overhead.",

Designed a custom face-mask detection model (MaskDetect), independently quantized and optimized for each hardware platform. Conducted an ablation study comparing MaskDetect to transfer-learning models (VGG16, ResNet-50V2, InceptionV3), achieving 94%+ accuracy on most platforms. Results demonstrated that Jetson Nano offers the best trade-off in accuracy (94.2%), inference speed, and cost, making it ideal for real-time deployment.",
